Hi, I'm James.

I'm running the infrastructure team for the <a
href='https://jasmin.ac.uk/'>JASMIN</a> project with @cedadev, within the @stfc
Scientific Computing team.

I'm a systems administrator/devops engineer, interested in running great
scientific services that make climate-science easier for our researchers.

On the web, my website is <a href='https://jph.im'>jph.im</a>, and I'm also on Mastodon: https://hachyderm.io/@jph.
